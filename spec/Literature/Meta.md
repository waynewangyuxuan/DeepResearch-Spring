## Paper Folder Structure

When a paper is important enough, create `Literature/{paper-slug}/`:
- `Summary.md` — structured: Problem / Method / Results / Relevance / Limitations
- `Notes.md` — free-form reading notes, annotations, questions
- `Connections.md` — optional: links to other papers and concepts
