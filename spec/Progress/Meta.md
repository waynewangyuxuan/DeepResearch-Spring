# Progress

> Session logs tracking research progress across four dimensions.

**Documents**: 1

## Session Entry Template

Each session entry records:
1. **Reading** — what was read + where are the notes
2. **Ideas** — new ideas + Ideas-Log links
3. **Prototypes** — what was built/tested + results
4. **Direction Changes** — strategic shifts (if any)

## Documents

| File | Lines | Summary | When to Read |
|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| [LATEST.md](LATEST.md) | ~20 | Most recent session log | Start of every new session |

## Convention

- LATEST.md always contains the most recent session entry
- When LATEST.md exceeds 100 lines, move older entries to archive files (YYYY-MM.md)
