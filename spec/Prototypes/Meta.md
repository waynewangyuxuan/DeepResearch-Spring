> Experimental code: each prototype tests one hypothesis.

**Documents**: 0 | **Subfolders**: 0

## Context Injection Guide

| Task Scenario | Read These Files | Lines |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Start a new prototype | ../Core/Regulation.md (Prototype section) | ~10 |
| Review existing prototypes | (this file — currently empty) | ~5 |

## Prototype Folder Structure

Each prototype lives in `proto-NNN-{slug}/`:
- `README.md` — hypothesis being tested + how to run
- `CHANGELOG.md` — human-readable change history
- `src/` — code
- `results/` — outputs (data, charts)

## Active Prototypes

(None yet. First prototype expected after literature reading round.)
