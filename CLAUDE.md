# DeepResearch-Spring

> In-context / Test-time Learning for Graph Construction in Deep Research

## Start Working

1. Read `spec/Meta.md` — project structure and context routing
2. Read `spec/Progress/LATEST.md` — where we left off last session
3. Read `spec/Concepts/Meta.md` — active concept designs
4. Read `spec/Literature/Reading-Queue.md` — current reading focus

## Project Context

- Research direction: Incremental Graph Construction as Context Engineering
- Team: Frederick (advisor), Wayne, Qisen, Qiyue (Bird), Chuong, Taggert
- Key infrastructure: IGC Pipeline (Qiyue), Search R1/MiroFlow baselines (Qisen)
- Benchmarks: Live Research Bench, Deep Research Bench 2

## Spec Location

All structured research materials are in `spec/`. Module specs in `exploratory-research-os/` and `research-dashboard/`.
